# Forkify Project

The Forkify API is used by the vanilla JavaScript application Forkify to retrieve and display recipe food data. This application leverages contemporary JavaScript technologies like Babel to translate ES6, ES7, and ES8 back to ES5, as well as Webpack to bundle the modules. The user may use local storage to find a specific recipe and store it to a favorites list. The user may examine thorough instructions and quickly increase or reduce portions based on his needs.
